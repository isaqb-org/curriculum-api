# Release Notes

## Intial Release 2025.1

The first version of the new API curriculum for the iSAQB Advanced Level portfolio focuses on the growing importance of Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) in modern software architecture. APIs are explored as technical, organizational, and business-oriented tools that enable communication between components, reduce development dependencies, and accelerate the creation of new services. The module emphasizes network-based APIs (not local interfaces) and covers both technical and strategic aspects, including value creation and team collaboration. This holistic approach ensures a broader understanding of APIs beyond purely technical considerations, making it relevant for architects, developers, and business stakeholders alike.
